# How to properly tag an atmospheric_physics commit

This page lists instructions for how to create a new atmospheric_physics tag.  A few rules:

1.  Tags should always be annotated (no lightweight tags).
2.  Tags should follow the naming convention listed below.
3.  Tags should point to merge commits into the main branch.
4.  Tags can only be created by people who have write access.

## How to create a git tag via the command line

You can create a new atmospheric_physics tag, assuming you have git installed on your local machine, by doing the following:

**1.  Download the latest version of the repo:**

```
git clone https://github.com/NCAR/atmospheric_physics.git
cd atmospheric_physics
```

If you are tagging a development commit, then also make sure to checkout the development branch:

```
git checkout development
```

**2.  Find the commit hash you want to tag.  This can be done by opening the git log like so:**

`git log`

And finding the commit hash you are tagging, along with the commit message.  If you simply want to tag the head of the repo (i.e. the latest commit), then do:

`git log --oneline -1`

And use the provided hash and message.

**3.  Create the tag:**

`git tag -a <tag> <commit_hash> -m '<commit_message>'`

Where `<tag>` is the new tag name (which should follow the naming convention shown below), `commit_hash` is the commit hash you found in step 2, and `commit_message` is the message/description associated with that commit.

**4.  Push the new tag back to the repo:**

`git push origin <tag>`

After which the new tag should now exist in the NCAR/atmospheric_physics repo.

## Tag naming conventions

All NCAR/atmospheric_physics tags for the main branch should look like the following:

`atmos_physX_YY_ZZZ`

While all tags for the development tag should be:

`dev_atmos_physX_YY_ZZZ`

Where `X` is the major release version (which should almost always be left as-is), `YY` is for whenever a new physics scheme or suite is added, and `zz` is for any other minor release/bug fix.

So, for example, if the latest tag is:

`atmos_phys0_05_025`

And you want to tag a new commit that fixed a bug, then the new tag should be:

`atmos_phys0_05_026`

However, if you instead added an entirely new physics scheme to the repo, then the new tag should be:

`atmos_phys0_06_000`

Hope that helps, and good luck with tagging!
