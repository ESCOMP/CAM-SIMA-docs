# 6 - Create an SDF
The **Suite Definition File (SDF)** tells the CCPP-Framework which schemes will be run in what order. For more, see [CCPP in CAM-SIMA](../design/ccpp-in-cam-sima.md)

- In `$CAM-SIMA/src/physics/ncar_ccpp`, create `suite_<parameterization>.xml`. This is your SDF!
- See the template below. You will need to select either `physics_before_coupler` or `physics_after_coupler` as your group name.
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<suite name="<parameterization>" version="1.0">  
   <group name="physics_X_coupler">  
       <scheme><parameterization></scheme>
   </group>
</suite>
```

| CAM physpkg routine | CAM-SIMA SDF Group     | Description |
|:--------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| tphysbc             | physics_before_coupler | Physics schemes run before the surface coupler is called |
| tphysac             | physics_after_coupler  | Physics schemes run after the surface coupler is called  |
</div>

- Add any interstitials which youâ€™ve created or are using in the appropriate location relative to your parameterization

For example: if your parameterization requires dry water vapor, you'll want to add:

- `<scheme>wet_to_dry_water_vapor</scheme>` before your core parameterization scheme to convert water vapor to a dry mixing ratio (CAM-SIMA has "wet")
- `<scheme>dry_to_wet_water_vapor</scheme>` after your parameterization scheme to convert back to a wet mixing ratio to return to CAM-SIMA

Once you have created your SDF, proceed to [7 - Check metadata](step7.md)
